Tribuo is a machine learning library in Java, providing
multi-class classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection and
multi-label classification. It provides implementations of popular ML
algorithms and also wraps other libraries, providing a common interface across
implementations. Tribuo contains all the code necessary to load, featurize,
and transform data. Additionally, it includes evaluation classes for all
supported prediction types. Development is led by <a href="https://labs.oracle.com">Oracle
Labs</a> Machine Learning Research Group, and we welcome community contributions.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
If you haven't used Tribuo before, the <a href="/learn/{{ site.doc_version }}/tutorials/irises-tribuo-v4.html">
Classification Tutorial</a> will help walk you through the basics of training
and testing a classifier, and saving and loading
the model you train. Once you have the basics down, move on the through the
rest of the <a href="/learn/{{ site.doc_version }}/tutorials">tutorials</a> to get
a broader tour of some of the capabilities of Tribuo.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <a href="/learn/{{ site.doc_version}}/docs/features.html">Features List</a> gives
an overview of what you can do with Tribuo and the algorithms that it supports
both natively and through interfaces to popular third-party libraries.

The best way to understand Tribuo is to read through
<a href="architecture.html">Tribuo's Architecture document</a>.
This covers some basic definitions, data flow, the library structure, configuration
(including options and provenance), data loading, transformations, details about
examples, and obfuscation features available to help mask your input features.

The <a href="packageoverview.html">Package Structure overview</a>
describes how the packages in Tribuo are organized around the machine learning
tasks that each one supports. These packages are grouped into modules so that
users of Tribuo can depend only on the pieces they need in their implementations.

Be sure to read up on the <a href="security.html">Security Considerations</a> around using
Tribuo and what the expectations are for its users.

For more odds and ends and general questions, the <a href="../faq.html">FAQ</a> is the place
to look. For details on all the classes and packages, consult
<a href="/learn/{{ site.doc_version }}/javadoc/">Tribuo's JavaDoc</a>.

<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>
We have tutorial notebooks for Classification, Clustering, Regression, Anomaly
Detection and the configuration system in
<a href="/learn/{{ site.doc_version }}/tutorials">tutorials</a>. These use the
<a href="https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava">IJava</a> Jupyter notebook kernel, and work
with Java 10+. It should be straight-forwad to convert the code in the tutorials
back to Java 8 code by replacing the <code>var</code> keyword with the appropriate types.

<h2>Configuration and Provenance</h2>
<p>
The trainers in Tribuo are fully configurable via the
<a href="https://github.com/oracle/olcut">OLCUT</a> configuration system. This allows a
user to define a trainer in an XML (or JSON or EDN) file once and repeatably
build models with exactly the same parameters. There are example configurations
for each of the supplied Trainers in the <code>config</code> folder of each package. Models
are serializable using Java serialization, as are the datasets themselves, and
the configuration used is stored with any model.

All models and evaluations include a serializable provenance object which
records when the model or evaluation was created, what data was used, any
transformations applied to the data, the hyperparameters of the trainer, and
for evaluations, what model was used. This information can be extracted out
into JSON, or can be serialised directly using Java serialisation. For
production deployments this provenance information can be redacted and replaced
with a hash to provide model tracking through an external system.

<h2>Platform Support & Requirements</h2>
<p>
Tribuo runs on Java 8+, and we test on LTS versions of Java, along with the
latest release.  Tribuo itself is a pure Java library and supported on all Java
platforms, however some of our interfaces require native code, and those are
supported only where the native library is. We test on x86_64 architectures on
Windows 10, macOS, and Linux (RHEL/OL/CentOS 7+), as these are supported
platforms for the native libraries we interface with. If you're interested in
another platform and wish to use one of the native library interfaces (ONNX
Runtime, TensorFlow, and XGBoost) then we recommend reaching out to the
developers of those libraries.
